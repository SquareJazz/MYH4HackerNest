## About Us

HackerNest is a nonprofit organization and movement that builds local tech communities around the world. We believe they are the cornerstones of economic development: we want more people to get into tech so they can afford to live healthier and happier. Our down-to-earth Tech Socials and epic, socially beneficial hackathons encourage camaraderie, collaboration, innovation, mentorship, knowledge-sharing, and so much more.

## The Challenge

We partner with government bodies to help people get in to STEM fields and in particular, programming. Most recently we partnered with the UK and Canadian governments to do a hackathon for helping people with Dementia. We believe that the young people of today are even more inventive than us, so we would like to see you come up with someone that would help people in some way live a better life. 

You can use any language, system, or idea you want. 

We will provide raspberry pis with sensors to be used in the hackathon in case you need them, though they are not required to be used.

## The Prize 

1x The CamJam EduKit #2 for each member of the winning team
1 x Raspberry Pi Zero V1.3, Raspberry Pi Zero Camera Cable & 8 MegaPixel Pi Camera for each member of the winning team.
